## Hi, I’m Varshitha 👋

I’m a Product + Analytics professional (ex-SDE in FinTech) who loves turning messy data and ambiguous problems into clear product decisions.
I’ve worked across lending and B2B-B2C payments/SaaS—partnering with engineering, data, and business teams to ship improvements that move metrics.

### What I work on
- Analytics: SQL/Python analysis, dashboards, KPI frameworks, experimentation basics
- Product execution: requirements, PRDs, Agile delivery, stakeholder alignment
- AI-enabled experiences: personalization concepts and recommendation systems basics

### Tools I use
SQL • Python • Snowflake • Tableau/Power BI/Looker • Excel • Jira/Confluence • AWS • APIs
